/// Rhea: A dynamic event-driven framework for iOS application lifecycle management and app-wide decoupling.
///
/// The Rhea framework provides a flexible and efficient way to manage the execution of code
/// at specific points in an iOS application's lifecycle and for custom events. It allows developers
/// to register callbacks for predefined lifecycle events or custom events, with fine-grained control
/// over execution priority and repeatability. This approach significantly helps in decoupling
/// different parts of the application, promoting a more modular and maintainable codebase.
///
/// Key features:
/// - Custom event registration: Define and trigger custom events in your application.
/// - Lifecycle event hooks: Easily attach callbacks to iOS app lifecycle events.
/// - Priority-based execution: Control the order of callback execution with customizable priorities.
/// - One-time or repeatable callbacks: Choose whether callbacks should execute once or multiple times.
/// - Macro-based registration: Use the `#rhea` macro for clean and concise callback registration.
/// - External event triggering: Trigger events programmatically from anywhere in your app.
/// - App-wide decoupling: Facilitate better separation of concerns and reduce dependencies between modules.
///
/// Rhea is designed to improve code organization, reduce coupling between components,
/// and provide a more declarative approach to handling app lifecycle and custom events.
///
/// Usage examples:
/// ```swift
/// // Registering a callback for a predefined lifecycle event
/// #rhea(time: .premain, func: { _ in
///     print("~~~~ premain")
/// })
///
/// // Defining a custom event
/// extension RheaEvent {
///     static let customEvent: RheaEvent = "customEvent"
/// }
///
/// // Registering a callback for a custom event
/// #rhea(time: .customEvent, priority: .normal, repeatable: true, func: { context in
///     // Code to run when user triggered "customEvent": `Rhea.trigger(event: .customEvent)`
/// })
/// ```
///
/// The `Rhea` class serves as the central point for event management and framework functionality,
/// enabling effective decoupling and modular design across the entire application.
@objc
public class Rhea: NSObject {
    
    /// Triggers a specific Rhea event and executes all registered callbacks for that event.
    ///
    /// This method activates all callbacks registered for the given event, passing them
    /// a context that includes any provided parameter.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - event: The `RheaEvent` to trigger. This identifies which set of callbacks should be executed.
    ///   - param: An optional parameter of type `Any?` that will be passed to the callbacks via the `RheaContext`.
    ///            This can be used to provide additional data to the callbacks. Defaults to `nil`.
    ///
    /// - Note:
    ///   - The method creates a new `RheaContext` for each trigger call.
    ///   - If a parameter is provided, it will be accessible in the callbacks through `context.param`.
    ///   - The `launchOptions` in the `RheaContext` will be `nil` for triggered events.
    ///   - Callbacks are executed in the order determined by their priority set during registration.
    ///
    /// - Important:
    ///   - Ensure that callbacks are prepared to handle a potentially `nil` parameter.
    ///   - Be mindful of the performance impact when triggering events with many registered callbacks.
    ///   - In callbacks, consider performance implications. For time-consuming operations,
    ///     use asynchronous processing or dispatch to background queues when appropriate.
    ///   - Avoid blocking the main thread in callbacks, especially for UI-related events.
