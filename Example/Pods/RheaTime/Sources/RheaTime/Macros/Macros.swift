/// Registers a callback function for a specific Rhea event.
///
/// This macro is used to register a callback function to a section in the binary,
/// associating it with a specific event time, priority, and repeatability.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - time: A `RheaEvent` representing the timing or event name for the callback.
///           This parameter also supports direct string input, which will be
///           processed by the framework as an event identifier.
///   - priority: A `RheaPriority` value indicating the execution priority of the callback.
///               Default is `.normal`. Predefined values include `.veryLow`, `.low`,
///               `.normal`, `.high`, and `.veryHigh`. Custom integer priorities are also
///               supported. Callbacks for the same event are sorted and executed based
///               on this priority.
///   - repeatable: A boolean flag indicating whether the callback can be triggered multiple times.
///                 If `false` (default), the callback will only be executed once.
///                 If `true`, the callback can be re-triggered on subsequent event occurrences.
///   - func: The callback function of type `RheaFunction`. This function receives a `RheaContext`
///           parameter, which includes `launchOptions` and an optional `Any?` parameter.
///
/// - Note: When triggering an event externally using `Rhea.trigger(event:param:)`, you can include
///              an additional parameter that will be passed to the callback via the `RheaContext`.
///
/// ```
/// #rhea(time: .load, priority: .veryLow, repeatable: true, func: { _ in
///     print("~~~~ load in Account Module")
/// })
///
/// #rhea(time: .registerRoute, func: { _ in
///     print("~~~~ registerRoute in Account Module")
/// })
///
/// // Use a StaticString as event directly
/// #rhea(time: "ACustomEventString", func: { _ in
///     print("~~~~ custom event")
/// })
/// ```
/// - Note: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ When extending ``RheaEvent`` with static constants, ensure that
///   the constant name exactly matches the string literal value. This practice
///   maintains consistency and prevents confusion.
///
